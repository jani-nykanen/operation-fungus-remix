**Operation Fungus Remix** is a remix of a side-scrolling shooter & "grinding game" I made over four years ago. 

To build the project, you need TypeScript compiler installed. Then just `cd` to root and type:
`tsc`
to build the project. You can run `dist.sh` to build a distributable zip file.

[You can play the game here](https://jani-nykanen.itch.io/operation-fungus-remix).
